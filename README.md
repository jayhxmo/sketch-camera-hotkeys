# sketch-camera-hotkeys
As a competitive StarCraft 2 player (a mechanically very demanding game), I was frustrated with how inefficient navigating around while designing was. I don't expect many people to find this useful, but I made it because:
1. I wanted to use it for myself (this is a direct port from SC2, but with non-conflicting hotkeys)
2. I wanted to learn how to create Sketch plugins


## Requirements
- Sketch 3.8+ to use "Follow Camera on Selection", but 3.0+ for the rest


## Installation
### From a release (best)
- [Download](https://github.com/jayhxmo/sketch-camera-hotkeys/releases) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on `sketch-camera-hotkeys.sketchplugin`

### From the source
- Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/jayhxmo/sketch-camera-hotkeys.git```
- Install dependencies ```npm install```
- Build ```npm run build```
- Double-click on `sketch-camera-hotkeys.sketchplugin`

## Customizing Shortcuts and Maintaining the Project
Clone and install the dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayhxmo/sketch-camera-hotkeys.git && npm install
```
You may need to run
```bash
npm install -g skpm && npm run postinstall
```

### Modifying manifest.json
This is where all shortcuts are defined. Because of the sheer amount of Create / Jump To Camera Location scripts, you can run the below to generate `manifest.json`. Make sure to modify `generate-manifest.js` instead of `src/manifest.json`, as the below script will overwrite `src/manifest.json`.
```bash
node generate-manifest
```

### Modifying Create / Jump To Camera Location 
`src/CreateCamera.js` and `src/JumpToCamera.js` are "templates", with `src/camera/*.js` generated by running
```bash
node generate-camera-files
```
or
```bash
./generate-camera
```

### Watching and Building
To watch and compile on changes, run the below. _Note that you may need to manually save changes to `src/manifest.json` after generating it to make sure it is picked up and updated in the compiled Sketch plugin._
```
npm run watch
```

To build, run
```bash
npm run build
```
